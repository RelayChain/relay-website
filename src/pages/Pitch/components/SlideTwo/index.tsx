        ZERO wants to unload a capped total of ZERO over the next four years whereby 60% is earmarked for the community, 21.5% goes to employees and 18.5% is set aside for investors. With 1 billion ZERO minted in the genesis block, the community will have to earn their 60% allocation
by supplying liquidity (or other community initiatives).
