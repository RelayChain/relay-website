        <h2>Liquidity Pools</h2>
        <p>
When liquidity pools - or LPs - provide liquidity, they receive pool tokens in exchange and they earn LP fees. Each pool token represents the LP’s share of the pool’s assets along with the trading fee percentage. So, these LP tokens are generated whenever funds are deposited into a pool. LPs can then trade these tokens or move them to other exchanges. And when an LP decides to reclaim their funds, their pool tokens are burned.
